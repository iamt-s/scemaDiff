Okay, let's analyze the schema diff and classify the changes as breaking or non-breaking, followed by Jest test stubs.

## Schema Diff Analysis: Breaking vs. Non-Breaking

Here's a breakdown of whether each added field represents a breaking or non-breaking change:

**NON-BREAKING CHANGES:**

-   `rtl: Boolean!`
    -   **Explanation:** Adding a non-nullable field `rtl` to a type (presumably an existing type, since the diff doesn't specify creation) is generally *not* a breaking change.  Existing queries that don't select this field will continue to function without modification. The server will provide the default value for the field.
-   `in: [String!]`
    -   **Explanation:**  Similarly, adding a list of non-nullable strings  `in` to a type is typically non-breaking. Existing queries won't be affected unless they explicitly request this new field.
-   `regex: String`
    -   **Explanation:** Adding a nullable `String` field named `regex` is a non-breaking change. Existing queries are unaffected.
-   `emoji: String`
    -   **Explanation:** Adding a nullable `String` field named `emoji` is a non-breaking change. Existing queries are unaffected.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

-   None of the listed changes are breaking.  Adding fields (even non-nullable ones) is generally backwards compatible, *as long as* the underlying resolvers can provide default values or the system handles them gracefully.  A breaking change usually involves removing fields, changing types of existing fields, or making nullable fields non-nullable.

## Jest Test Stubs (TypeScript)

Here are some Jest test stubs to help verify the schema changes.  These tests assume you have a way to introspect the GraphQL schema (e.g., using `graphql-tools` to load it from SDL files or from a running GraphQL server).  They also assume you have a way to execute GraphQL queries against a test server or schema.

```typescript
import { graphql } from 'graphql'; // Or import your preferred GraphQL execution method
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema'; // or your schema building method
import gql from 'graphql-tag'; // Or your preferred way to define GraphQL queries/mutations

describe('Schema Changes', () => {
  let schema: any; // Replace 'any' with your schema type

  beforeAll(() => {
    // Load your schema here.  This is just a placeholder.
    // Replace with your actual schema loading mechanism.
    // For example:
    // schema = buildSchema(fs.readFileSync('schema.graphql', 'utf8'));

    const typeDefs = gql`
      type Query {
        testObject: TestObjectType
      }

      type TestObjectType {
        id: ID!
        existingField: String
        rtl: Boolean!
        in: [String!]
        regex: String
        emoji: String
      }
    `;

    const resolvers = {
      Query: {
        testObject: () => ({
          id: '123',
          existingField: 'test',
          rtl: true,
          in: ['a', 'b'],
          regex: '.*',
          emoji: ':)',
        }),
      },
    };
    schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });
  });

  it('should have the new rtl field on TestObjectType', async () => {
    const query = gql`
      query {
        testObject {
          rtl
        }
      }
    `;
    const result = await graphql({ schema, source: query.loc?.source.body });

    expect(result).toEqual({
      data: {
        testObject: {
          rtl: true,
        },
      },
    });
    expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
  });

  it('should have the new in field on TestObjectType', async () => {
    const query = gql`
      query {
        testObject {
          in
        }
      }
    `;

    const result = await graphql({ schema, source: query.loc?.source.body });

    expect(result).toEqual({
      data: {
        testObject: {
          in: ['a', 'b'],
        },
      },
    });
    expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
  });

  it('should have the new regex field on TestObjectType', async () => {
    const query = gql`
      query {
        testObject {
          regex
        }
      }
    `;

    const result = await graphql({ schema, source: query.loc?.source.body });

    expect(result).toEqual({
      data: {
        testObject: {
          regex: '.*',
        },
      },
    });
    expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
  });

  it('should have the new emoji field on TestObjectType', async () => {
    const query = gql`
      query {
        testObject {
          emoji
        }
      }
    `;

    const result = await graphql({ schema, source: query.loc?.source.body });

    expect(result).toEqual({
      data: {
        testObject: {
          emoji: ':)',
        },
      },
    });
    expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
  });

  it('should not break existing queries when selecting existing fields', async () => {
    const query = gql`
      query {
        testObject {
          id
          existingField
        }
      }
    `;

    const result = await graphql({ schema, source: query.loc?.source.body });

    expect(result).toEqual({
      data: {
        testObject: {
          id: '123',
          existingField: 'test',
        },
      },
    });
    expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
  });
});
```

Key points about the tests:

*   **Schema Loading:**  The `beforeAll` block is where you'll load your actual schema. Replace the placeholder comment with your specific schema loading logic.
*   **Query Execution:** The tests use `graphql` (from the `graphql` package) to execute queries against the schema. Adapt this if you're using a different GraphQL execution environment.
*   **Test Structure:** Each `it` block tests for the presence of one of the new fields.  They execute a simple query that selects only that new field and asserts that the result contains the expected data.
*   **Existing Queries:** There's a test to verify that existing queries continue to work after the schema changes.
*   **Error Checking:**  Each test checks that `result.errors` is `undefined`, indicating that the query executed successfully without any GraphQL errors.
*   **`graphql-tag`:**  The tests use `graphql-tag` (or `gql`) to define the GraphQL queries in a readable format. You can use any method you prefer to construct your queries.
*   **Mocked Resolvers:**  The `resolvers` object within `beforeAll` provides mock resolvers for the `TestObjectType`. This is essential to provide data for the new fields being added. In a real-world scenario, you would use your actual data fetching logic.
*   **`source: query.loc?.source.body`:** The tests are retrieving the query text from the query location within the GraphQL Tag definition. This provides the query text in a string format, which is how `graphql` accepts the query.

Remember to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install graphql @graphql-tools/schema graphql-tag --save-dev
# or
yarn add graphql @graphql-tools/schema graphql-tag --dev
```

These tests give you a basic framework for verifying your schema changes. You can expand upon them to test more complex scenarios and edge cases.  Crucially, make sure your schema loading and query execution mechanisms are properly configured to match your project's setup.
