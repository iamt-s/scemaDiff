Okay, here's the classification of the schema changes, along with explanations and Jest test stubs:

### BREAKING CHANGES:

None.

### NON-BREAKING CHANGES:

-   **ADDED: `rtl: Boolean!`**:  Adding a new non-nullable field (`Boolean!`) to a type is generally *not* breaking *if* the type is used as an argument to a query or mutation, or if the type is returned from a query or mutation and the client can handle additional fields.  If it's *only* returned by a query, and the clients do not rely on strict matching of the return type, it's non-breaking. The `!` indicates that a value *must* be provided. If the backing resolver is changed in a way that now returns `null` when it previously returned a value, or when no value was previously returned, this could be considered breaking. However, simply adding a field and populating it with a value is non-breaking.

-   **ADDED: `in: [String!]`**: Adding a new field of type `[String!]` (list of non-nullable strings) is generally non-breaking for the same reasons as above. The server just needs to provide values for these fields. The client can handle the existence of a new field.

-   **ADDED: `regex: String`**: Adding a new nullable `String` field is non-breaking. Clients can gracefully handle the presence of a new field or its absence (null value).

-   **ADDED: `emoji: String`**:  Adding a new nullable `String` field is non-breaking for the same reason as `regex`.

```typescript
describe('Schema Changes', () => {
  it('should not break existing queries when adding "rtl: Boolean!"', () => {
    // Mock existing query result
    const existingQueryResult = {
      // existing data here
    };

    // Mock new query result with the added field
    const newQueryResult = {
      ...existingQueryResult,
      rtl: true, // Or false, depending on the data
    };

    // Assertion: existing query can still process the response.
    expect(() => {
      // Simulate existing query processing the new result
      // e.g., using existingQueryResult to render UI, which
      //  should not break with the 'rtl' field added.
      // If your existing code does something very brittle that
      //  fails when extra fields are present, THEN this *would* be breaking.
      // A common example: If the field being added contains sensitive
      // information, and the client serializes it, then it could break
      // security expectations.

    }).not.toThrow();
  });

  it('should not break existing queries when adding "in: [String!]"', () => {
    const existingQueryResult = {
      // existing data here
    };

    const newQueryResult = {
      ...existingQueryResult,
      in: ["value1", "value2"],
    };

    expect(() => {}).not.toThrow(); // Replace with real assertion
  });

  it('should not break existing queries when adding "regex: String"', () => {
    const existingQueryResult = {
      // existing data here
    };

    const newQueryResult = {
      ...existingQueryResult,
      regex: "some regex", // Or null
    };

    expect(() => {}).not.toThrow(); // Replace with real assertion
  });

  it('should not break existing queries when adding "emoji: String"', () => {
    const existingQueryResult = {
      // existing data here
    };

    const newQueryResult = {
      ...existingQueryResult,
      emoji: "ðŸ˜€", // Or null
    };

    expect(() => {}).not.toThrow(); // Replace with real assertion
  });
});
```

Key points about the Jest tests:

*   **Focus on Existing Queries:** The tests simulate how *existing* queries (and their handling on the client) would behave when encountering the new fields. The goal is to verify that the addition of the fields does *not* cause any errors or unexpected behavior.
*   **Realistic Data:** The mock `newQueryResult` objects contain realistic values for the added fields. This ensures that the tests cover different scenarios.
*   **Assertion:**  The `expect(() => {}).not.toThrow()` is a placeholder.  The *real* assertion should simulate your existing client-side code processing the `newQueryResult`. For example, it might involve rendering a UI component or extracting data from the result. The `toThrow` assertion verifies that this processing does not throw an error.  The comments inside each test provide examples of what to assert.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Client-Side Handling:**  The classification of non-breaking assumes that clients are tolerant of extra fields in the response.  If clients perform strict validation against the schema, or if they have code that will crash when encountering an unexpected field, then these changes *could* be breaking.
*   **Nullability:**  The `!` indicates non-nullable fields.  If the server *fails* to provide values for these fields, it will cause an error. While this is technically not a schema *breaking change*, it can cause client-side errors if the server is misconfigured.
*   **Performance:** Adding fields can impact performance. While not *breaking* in terms of functionality, a significant performance degradation could be considered a negative change.
*   **Sensitive Information:** If the added field contains sensitive information and existing clients naively serialize the data (e.g., logging everything to the console), this could introduce a security vulnerability.

Remember to adapt these tests to your specific codebase and use cases.
