Okay, here's the classification of the schema changes, their explanations, and the Jest test stubs, all formatted as requested.

## Schema Change Classification

Here's the classification of the provided schema changes as breaking or non-breaking:

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   None.  The provided additions are all adding fields, not removing or altering existing ones.

**NON-BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   `rtl: Boolean!` - Adding a new non-nullable field `rtl` is generally a non-breaking change.  Clients that don't request this field will continue to work as before.  Clients that *do* request this field will now receive data, but older clients wouldn't have been expecting it anyway.
*   `in: [String!]` - Adding a new field `in` that is a list of non-nullable strings. This is non-breaking for the same reason as the `rtl` field.
*   `regex: String` - Adding a new nullable field `regex` is a non-breaking change. Clients not requesting it are unaffected, and clients that do can handle the possibility of `null`.
*   `emoji: String` - Adding a new nullable field `emoji` is a non-breaking change. Clients not requesting it are unaffected, and clients that do can handle the possibility of `null`.

## Jest Test Stubs (TypeScript)

Here's a set of Jest test stubs in TypeScript that you can adapt to verify these schema changes. These tests will generally check that the fields are present and have the correct types.  **Important:**  These are *stubs* and will need to be adapted to your specific schema loading and introspection methods.  You'll need to replace placeholder functions like `loadSchema()` and `introspectSchema()` with your actual implementations.  Also, the specifics of how you check for types in `introspectSchema()` output depend on the library you use for schema introspection.

```typescript
describe('Schema Changes', () => {
  let schema: any; // Replace 'any' with a more specific type if possible

  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Replace loadSchema() with your actual schema loading function.
    // This could involve reading from a file, fetching from a server, etc.
    // schema = await loadSchema(); // Example: loadSchema('./schema.graphql');
    // Simulate schema loading for testability
    schema = {
      getType: (typeName: string) => {
        if (typeName === 'Query') { // Assuming a 'Query' type exists
          return {
            getFields: () => ({}), // Initially empty fields
          };
        }
        return null;
      },
    };
  });

  it('should have added the "rtl" field with type Boolean!', async () => {
      // Example approach using introspection (replace with your actual introspection method)
      const queryType = schema.getType('Query'); // Replace 'Query' if applicable
      const fields = queryType.getFields();
      expect(fields).toBeDefined();

      // Mimic adding fields for testing purposes
      fields.rtl = { type: { name: 'Boolean', nonNull: true } }; // simulate the field addition

      expect(fields.rtl).toBeDefined();
      expect(fields.rtl.type.name).toBe('Boolean');
      expect(fields.rtl.type.nonNull).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should have added the "in" field with type [String!]', async () => {
      const queryType = schema.getType('Query');
      const fields = queryType.getFields();
      expect(fields).toBeDefined();

      fields.in = { type: { kind: 'LIST', ofType: { name: 'String', nonNull: true } } };

      expect(fields.in).toBeDefined();
      expect(fields.in.type.kind).toBe('LIST');
      expect(fields.in.type.ofType.name).toBe('String');
      expect(fields.in.type.ofType.nonNull).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should have added the "regex" field with type String', async () => {
      const queryType = schema.getType('Query');
      const fields = queryType.getFields();
      expect(fields).toBeDefined();

      fields.regex = { type: { name: 'String' } };

      expect(fields.regex).toBeDefined();
      expect(fields.regex.type.name).toBe('String');
  });

  it('should have added the "emoji" field with type String', async () => {
      const queryType = schema.getType('Query');
      const fields = queryType.getFields();
      expect(fields).toBeDefined();

      fields.emoji = { type: { name: 'String' } };

      expect(fields.emoji).toBeDefined();
      expect(fields.emoji.type.name).toBe('String');
  });
});

```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Schema Loading:**  The key is to correctly load and introspect your GraphQL schema in the `beforeAll` block.  Adjust the `loadSchema()` placeholder to your specific needs.
*   **Introspection:**  The `introspectSchema()` placeholder and the way you access the fields and their types need to match your schema introspection library (e.g., `graphql-tools`, `apollo-server`, or your own custom implementation).
*   **Error Handling:** Add appropriate error handling for schema loading and introspection failures.
*   **Type Checking:** The code above assumes simple type names.  For more complex types (e.g., custom scalar types or types within other types), you'll need to adjust the type checking logic accordingly.
*   **`graphql` package:** You will need to have the `graphql` package installed in your project (`npm install graphql` or `yarn add graphql`).

Remember to adapt the test stubs to your specific schema and testing environment. The provided code gives you a starting point.
